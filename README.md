# ABC Typing Quest

![ABC Typing Quest Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Once upon a time, my five-year-old son and I were sitting outside, when he noticed the keys on my laptop's keyboard, and started finding the letters.

I thought to myself, "Oh, it'd be cool to show him a typing game so he could explore the keyboard."

I typed in what I was looking for into ChatGPT.com (because Google has gotten so bad these days), expecting it to find me an existing game, but instead, it just built the app in one go.

Then, my son made his first feature-request: he wanted the game to guide the player through typing the alphabet by displaying the next letter to type.
